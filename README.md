# Electrocardiography-ECG-Analysis
This repository contains MATLAB code for basic ECG (Electrocardiogram) signal analysis and feature extraction. The code demonstrates how to load ECG data, plot the signal, calculate R-R intervals, assess heart rate variability (HRV), and analyze electrical alternans.
